Lab 1

# Summary
The purpose of the lab was to create a goofy motor utilizing 3 materials. A magnet, copper wire, and AA battery. After constructing it, we were able to learn a few things about basic motor fucntions.

# Procedure
1. Gather matrials needed:
   - 16 AWG Copper wire
   - Magnets
   - AA battery
   - Steel punch
   - X-Acto knife
2. Use the steel punch to create a small indent on the top of the battery so that it has a stable point of contact for the copper wire to pivot around. Be careful not to let the punch "punch." Rather, let it dent the top without using the punch feature or else you risk puncturing the battery.
3. Unwind and cut a piece of wire about 7-8 inches in length. Carefully scrape the enamel off the tips and in the middle of the wire where it will be resting on the pivot point. We are going with a rectangular shape for this experiment.
4. bend the wire from the center and have it seperate into two rectagnles that run down the length of the battery.
5. Attach the magnets and then place the wire on top with the ends touching the magents and watch it spin!

# Conclusions
### Observations
As we watched our goofy little motor spin and spin, we often had trouble balancing the wire. Sometimes it would spin fast enough to knock itself off. Other times, it wouldn't spin at all due to being unbalanced so it wouldn't have stable contact points. The first iteration of the motor was using a spiral bend. That made balancing even harder becasue sometimes the spiral spun then got stuch on the wire. And when it was wide enough to avoid contact, it would fun a way to fall off.

We observed that if you prevented the wire from moving, the wire would heat up in a matter of seconds. As the wire spins in air, it cools itself and becasue of the movement, it doesn't heat up as fast in these instances.

When we bend the wire in a rectangle, the wire is now ortogonal to the magnetic field resulting in a better transfer of force to move the wire with more torque.

### Friction
Now that we are in an ideal world, we hae friction to deal with. The wire ends and in contact with the steel end of the battery and magents will have some friction. This friction leads to the wire moving slower as we lose the transfer of energy to this small amount of friction. One way to reduce friction is the apply some type of lubricant to the ends and let it spin.

### Drag
As the wire moves through the air, drag is introduced as it increased in speed. Drag is increased by increasing the surface area of the wire. shape of the bends and size of the wire contribute.


# Bonus Experiment
For fun, I tried connecting two batteries in series to result in a a voltage of 3V. Then I created a similiar wire rectangle design to let it spin on this new and improved goofy motor. It didn't spin as fast as before but it had more torque. I observed this by placing my finger in front of the wire and seeing how much pushing power they both had. This makes sense because more mass means more momentum.
