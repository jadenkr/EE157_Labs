# Summary
The purpose of the lab was to create a goofy motor utilizing 3 materials. A magnet, copper wire, and AA battery. After constructing it, we were able to learn a few things about basic motor fucntions.

# Procedure
1. Gather matrials needed:
  - Copper wire
  - Magnets
  - AA battery
  - Steel punch
  - X-Acto knife
2. Use the steel punch to create a small indent on the top of the battery so that it has a stable point of contact for the copper wire to pivot around. Be careful not to let the punch "punch." Rather, let it dent the top without using the punch feature or else you risk puncturing the battery.
3. Unwind and cut a piece of wire about 7-8 inches in length. Carefully scrape the enamel off the tips and in the middle of the wire where it will be resting on the pivot point. We are going with a rectangular shape for this experiment.
